## History

Not much is known about the history of his moderator account since he mostly was busy with the server. Though a lot of footage of his work on the server is available on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYO5axZoTcEEX_FQKsDFrQ) channel. The most viewed video on his YouTube channel is a introduction video about Scrubcraft.

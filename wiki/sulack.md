[Sulack](sulack) is the server owner and lead developer of the [ScrubCraft](scrubcraft) Minecraft server. Sulack was probably one of the first players on the Scrubcraft server. However this is his moderator account and he does not play survival on it. When he actualy does play survival he will be playing om his alt [Kcalus](kcalus).

## History

Not much is known about the history of his moderator account since he mostly was busy with the server. Though a lot of footage of his work on the server is available on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYO5axZoTcEEX_FQKsDFrQ) channel. The most viewed video on his YouTube channel is a [introduction video](https://youtu.be/T9J56Wdcx98) for the Scrubcraft Minecraft server.

One of the most notable events in the history of Sulack was that he announced that "The age of Market-Driven freedom" is over and that the "perfect, never flawed Dictatorsh....Peoples Democratic Republic has been formed". After this announcement he also changed his skin to a Kim Jong-un like version of his skin.

One of his most impactful addition to the server may be the [10K](10k) and the [Outlaw](outlaw) system.

## Activities

Unlike what many players believe Sulack can see and do a lot more things than they realize. Sulack can and will for example see what you are saying with the /msg command. Sometimes Sulack will fly arround in vanish and see what you are up too. Some players might say that this is unfair, however this is a pretty standard practice for a server owner and almost every owner of a server has this ability.

Sulack also tends to AFK a lot, butt let this not deceive you since he just might be not responding to your messages.

Over the course of the server Sulack has added/removed a lot of things to the Minecraft server. Some notable things sulack has added to Minecraft server are:
- [Spawn](spawn) (Over the course of the server the spawn has changed a lot.)
- [Cosmetics](cosmetics)
- [Headhunter](headhunter) (A sword which drops a players sword when they are killed with this sword.)
- [EdgeStone](edgestone)
- [Modtown](modtown) (A town created by the original players of ScrubCraft where some player owned shops are located.)
- [Server Hearts](server_hearts)

## Updates

Sulack is known to update the Minecraft server in the discord server, here is a list of some notable ones:

| Date     | Message |
|----------|---------|
| 24-02-2021 | Server Hearts and EdgeStone - The Phycology of Value. Now that the systems are in place I want to give people a bit of an introduction to Server Hearts and Edgestone. One of Minecraft's major multiplayer flaws lies in ability to asses value, as the means of production for most items defy consistent laws. Iron is too abundant, the dragon egg is to rare, obsidian is too bulky, and villager didn't exactly study economics so their emerald system a little flawed. Diamonds are essentially the only item so far that works anything like a currency, with a single diamond being the equivalent to tens of real world dollars. If value need to be represented in game, then developers need a way restrict their unlimited power from undermining the power of the users work. The majority of large servers use abstract currencies that are held as a type of "Credit", giving you numbers in a database in the same way your local bank works. I for one believe that there are better ways. My way of communicating value with users is through the Server Hearts. You will be able to earn Hearts by completing certain challenges which will be burned when purchasing custom items, magic world challenges, and other Developer built events. Adding value without interfering with material economics. To Compress or not to Compress? Compressing 4 Server Hearts will make Soulbound Edgestone, but saving Hearts may actually provide you with discounts or special items in the future. While not every challenge will be announced, I will slowly be reviling them as they are constructed. Each 10kx0 location has a chest that gives you a 1/4 chance of receiving a heart. A 3/4 chance of finding junk. Every week your reward will refresh. Every chest could have a heart, or none. 10k Boss NPCs will now drop hearts on death. Their spawn times have been increased be a significant amount. You will need to track their spawns. |
| 15-02-2021 | Also from now on greifing within 10k will have the greifers name shared. This will not be retroactive, so previous greif proof is on the players to find out, but any further action will be exposed. |
| 15-02-2021 | With the introduction of the ability to expel players from 10k, we will be putting crimes on trial in MC general. If a player has committed an act of terrorism, you are allowed to post here for community consensus. If a large amount of support is shown action will be taken. Crimes can only be reported by those who had the action taken against them, or by a designated representative if the player does not have discord. |
| 15-02-2021 | The temptation to pull out creative to resolve disputes is often too easy. While it may make people feel better short term, in the long term it degrades the quality of minecraft story-building gameplay. Items are not just digital numbers on a sheet. They contain historical value through the tension created around them. Value comes from the journey. If I was to treat those items as numbers on a sheet I feel it would remove their significance. Cheating back those items because someone used in-game tactics dilutes their value. It was my fault by assuming a larger group of players would provide protection against a single opponent. Crystal PVP is very powerful when your guard is down. I created a false sense of security, I took precautions to keep space from them and not hold good items given their reputation yet conveyed a sense of security due to my position as owner. |
| 01-02-2021 | Particle Elytras have been changed to have durability, and now only show particles when flying. Tho I have increased particles and added more elytras as a bonus. |
| 26-01-2021 | Alright The age of Market-Driven freedom is over. The perfect, never flawed Dictatorsh....Peoples Democratic Republic has been formed. I have promoted the best and brightest into ranks that will ensure the peoples happiness. Under this rule everyone will get to enjoy the great and giving leaders guidance in their every day life. You will all be blessed with having your gameplay monitored to ensure maximum happiness. I have given the powers to select individuals who will relay all information to the great and powerful leader... me. Those who do not embody our ideas of happiness will be sent to "Happy Education Camps" where they will learn about all the great things the perfect leader does to ensure the world continues. If the persons mental capabilities prevents from understanding the great leaders choices, they will be sent to a "Community Positive Facility" where their socially dangerous actions are kept from our perfect society. I hope you all enjoy North KoSuland. We have no problems here. |
| 02-01-2021 | Alright minecraft, with bitcoin hitting 30k, and promised funding for the server essentially disappearing, we need to scale back operations as I am now out of a few thousand dollars and can no longer afford to spend the time working on the server. I am out of savings and will not be able to pay my bills. In short I have lost way more money that I ever intended and need to go find a job. By the end of our current server contract, unless I can hit $200 a month supporters I am forced to significantly scale the server back down to 15 to 20 people. Potentially less. I know as business choices if I cant pay for it... I cant pay for it. Thats the way it is. If you dont want this than I will need someone to either match my losses monthly, or get their group of friends to pool in. |
| 03-12-2020 | Hey Guys, as we have had many new members in the past while its time for my almost montly reminder. Please take into consideration how you choose to contact me, I have had 10+ messages since monday with rather unpleasent tones. I do not respond to infomationless messages. Anything alone the lines of "Sulack" "I have a problem" "TP to me" "Get online" "Answer my call" "give me items" "I lost my stuff" "Somone killed me" Are incredibly unpleasent messages to wake up to in the morning. It may not seem that way when sending the message, but I can assure you its not enjoyable at all on my end. If you have an issue, please state clearly what that issue is. It is a complete waste of my time typing "Yes?" to 5 - 10 people every morning. If you do want my immidiate attention you can become a Patreon Supporter. I generally respond very quickly to those funding our community, and people who politely provide me with enough information to solve their problem. |

However this is his moderator account and does not play survival on it. When he actualy does play survival he will be playing om his alt [Kcalus](kcalus).

## History

Not much is known about the history of his moderator account since he mostly was busy with the server. Though a lot of footage of his work on the server is available on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYO5axZoTcEEX_FQKsDFrQ) channel. The most viewed video on his YouTube channel is a [introduction video](https://youtu.be/T9J56Wdcx98) for the Scrubcraft Minecraft server.

## Activities

Unlike what many players believe Sulack can see and do a lott more things than they realize. Sulack can and will for example see what you are saying with the /msg command. Sometimes Sulack will fly arround in vanish and see what you are up too. Some players might say that this is unfair, however this is a pretty standard practice for a server owner and almost every owner of a server has this ability.

Sulack also tends to be a lot of AFK, butt let this not deceive you since he just might be not responding to your messages.

Over the course of the server Sulack has added/removed a lot of things to the Minecraft server. Some noteable things sulack has added to Minecraft server are:
- [Spawn](spawn) (Over the course of the server the spawn has changed a lot.)
- [Cosmetics](cosmetics)
- [Headhunter](headhunter) (A sword which drops a players sword when they are killed with this sword.)
- [EdgeStone](edgestone)
- [Modtown](modtown) (A town created by the original players of ScrubCraft where some player owned shops are located.)
- [Server Hearts](server_hearts)

## History

Not much is known about the history of his moderator account since he mostly was busy with the server. Though a lot of footage of his work on the server is available on his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBYO5axZoTcEEX_FQKsDFrQ) channel. The most viewed video on his YouTube channel is a [introduction video](https://youtu.be/T9J56Wdcx98) for the Scrubcraft Minecraft server.

## Activities

Unlike what many players believe Sulack can see and do a lott more things than they realize. Sulack can and will for example see what you are saying with the /msg command. Sometimes Sulack will fly arround in vanish and see what you are up too. Some players might say that this is unfair, however this is a pretty standard practice for a server owner and almost every owner of a server has this ability.

Sulack also tends to be a lot of AFK, butt let this not deceive you since he just might be not responding to your messages.
